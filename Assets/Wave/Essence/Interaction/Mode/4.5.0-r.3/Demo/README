Ths "NaturalHand" sample uses the Wave XR plugin pinch temporary achievement by default.
The achievement depends on the Main Camera and wrist location and works only when the hand service does NOT provide the pinch origin/direction.
You may need to configure the "Pinch Offset X" and "Pinch Offset Y" value in EventSystem > NaturalHandInputModule to change the pinch pointer location.

If you would like to use the Wave hand service pinch solution instead of XR plugin pinch temporary achievement, you need to
1. Enable the "IgnoreMe" GameObject.
2. Disable the "XRLeftHand" GameObject.
3. Disable the "XRRightHand" GameObject.
4. In EventSystem, remove the "Natural Hand Input Module"
5. In EventSystem, add the "Hand Input Module"
6. In EventSystem > HandInputModule, click the button "Creates a right selector" and "Creates a left selector".
7. In EventSystem > HandInputModule, select the "Ignore Mode".
